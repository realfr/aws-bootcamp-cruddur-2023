## Notes
For the Cloud Technical Essay, I am leaning towards "Expanding on the theoretical architecture by solution architecting systems that don’t exist" or "Applied technology outside the scope of the bootcamp to the project".

Some Ideas I have for it:
- I can start a new project and apply my learnings from the bootcamp as I progress and then I can start writing about my decisions on the project repo. Then I can put all my notes together and submit it as the essay.
- I can start writing mini articles based on what I learned. For example, I could write a mini guide article that explains how to create requirements based on what I learned from the bootcamp.
